# EPYC OFFHAND
***This plugin was created to address the well-known offhand bug, which is commonly exploited on BoxPvP servers. The bug occurs when players use a firework rocket and quickly switch it to their offhand repeatedly, allowing them to escape from cobwebs.***

 **The plugin offers three configurable methods to prevent this exploit:â€‹**

**METHOD 1:** Players are allowed to place the rocket in their offhand, but the hand swap key (default: F) is disabled. This means players cannot switch items between their main hand and offhand using the hand swap key.

**METHOD 2:** This method completely prevents players from placing rockets in their offhand. This includes any action such as clicking or dragging the rocket to the offhand slot.

**METHOD 3:** This method blocks players from switching rockets to their offhand only when they are inside a cobweb. This restriction applies specifically to the context where the exploit would be used to escape from cobwebs.

**METHOD 4:** This method completely disables the functionality of the offhand slot, effectively preventing any item from being placed or used in the offhand. This ensures that attempts to equip or utilize items in the offhand slot are entirely blocked, maintaining the primary hand's usage without interference.
